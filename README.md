## Backlog Order Rationale
Backlog order rationale was based on the functions needed to be to before the others since the system functiona all depend on each other so the programming model or process would be like waterfall finish base functions first then we finish next set of functions that depend on base funcations.

## Workflow
![workflow Image](WorkFlow.png)
1. At first we start by creating our issue then it is Put into the To Do status as long as we didn't start working on it.
2. The issue is moved from To Do to In Progress status when we start including it into a sprint and start that sprint.
3. Status is changed from In Progress to Done when the issue we were working on is finished and meets the definition of done.
